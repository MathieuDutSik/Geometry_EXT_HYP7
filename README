    EXT-HYP7

This program computes all the extreme rays of the cone HYP7.
The last version of this program is available from
http://drobilica.irb.hr/~mathieu/

This program use:

the "dreadnaut" program from the nauty package 
http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/

the "cdd" polyhedral program by Komei Fukuda
http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~fukuda/soft/cdd_home/cdd.html

Both cddr+_gmp should be available from the command line.
Also perl should be in /usr/bin/perl

This program computes the list of all 26 orbits and extreme rays

   HOW TO RUN THE ENUMERATION (on linux)

Extract the archive
tar -vxzf EXT-HYP7.tar.gz

Go into the archive
cd EXT-HYP7

run the program by
./RUN_ENUMERATION

   HOW TO GET THE DATAS

The list of 26 orbits of extreme rays is available in ListOrbit.

   TODO

The whole enumeration take as granted that we know the list of
3773 facets and 37170 extreme rays of the hypermetric cone HYP7. 

Those lists were actually computed by Baranovskii and M.Dutour.
At present they are in the directory WORK-PERM but they should
be generated at the beginning of the computation.
